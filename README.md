# Fraud Detection: Credit Card Security

This repository contains code for a comprehensive credit card fraud detection project using machine learning techniques. The project focuses on building models to detect fraudulent transactions in credit card data.

## Overview

Credit card fraud is a prevalent issue affecting financial institutions and individuals worldwide. Detecting fraudulent transactions is crucial for maintaining financial security and trust.

This project aims to:

- Explore and preprocess credit card transaction data.
- Train and evaluate machine learning models for fraud detection.
- Interpret model predictions to gain insights into fraud detection mechanisms.

## Key Features

- **Data Exploration**: Understand the structure and characteristics of credit card transaction data.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, engineer new features, and scale data for modeling.
- **Model Building**: Train and evaluate classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
- **Model Interpretability**: Utilize the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) library to interpret model predictions and understand feature importance.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/reminfrankline/Fraud-Detection-Credit-Card-Security.git
   ```

2. Open and run the `Fraud_Detection.py`.
